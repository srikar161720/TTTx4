## Purpose
> The purpose of the project was to try and experience using Swift and SwiftUI in Xcode to build an app from scratch. This project is a recreation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, but the grid is a slightly larger 4 x 4 grid. All the same rules apply (The first one to place the same symbol in the grid in a vertical/horizontal/diagonal line wins the game.)

## Tools Utilized
> **Swift** and **SwiftUI**, built and tested in **Xcode**.

## Challenges
> The biggest hurdle was the fact that this was my first time programming in Swift, which meant that I needed to learn everything from scratch. I had to spend multiple hours watching tutorial videos on YouTube as I was putting my project together, which meant a significant amount of backtracking. Since I was new to the programming language, there were many times that I ran into tiny issues related to the app layouts and UI, which took a considerable amount of time to fix.

## Credits/Acknowledgments
> No public libraries or frameworks were used in the creation of this project.
> The YouTube channel *CodeWithChris* significantly helped me put this project together and figure this out on my own.
